# Competitive Programming

This is an intro to competitive programming. This is supposed to cover some of the basic information needed to get started.

## Platforms

There are several different platforms to practice competitive programming. Here is a few of the important ones:

- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/universities/upei.ca): Kattis is the site that most UPEI competitive programmers go to. It has the nicest interface of any platform, and a lot of good problems to solve. You increase rank by solving problems, either in contests or on your own time.
- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/): the most active platform with lots of good information, though getting used to the interface can take some time. Ranks are based off an elo system that changes depending on how good you do in regularly hosted contests.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): Project Euler is a platform focused around math problems.

It's important to note you don't have to just go on one! You can do a bit on each if you'd like.
